# PaymentCardWallet
Bitcoin/cryptocurrency wallet that uses a credit-card-like card with an RFID chip as a second factor,
so coins can only be spent if the card is in close proximity to the device on which the wallet software is runnning.

The CardWallet document describes the motivation and the project.
The CardWalletDesign document describes some of the technical details.
The CardWalletGeneration.pdf document is a diagram that accompanies the CardWalletDesign document.
